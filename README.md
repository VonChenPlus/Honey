* LocalFile IO and Socket IO.
* Smart Pointer.
* Math Library.
* Some Utils.

Licenses
--------
This library, for my convenience, incorporates code from a variety of public domain or similarly-licensed code. This is the list:

* glew (GL extension wrangler), MIT license. TODO: should just use a submodule.

If you're not okay with the licenses above, don't use this code.

I hereby release all code here not under the licenses above under the MIT license.
