Native
======

This is my library of stuff that I use when writing C++ programs

Features
--------
* Basic OpenGL utility code, like compressed texture loading(almost from Henrik Rydgård)
* 2D texture atlases and drawing code(almost from Henrik Rydgård)
* ETC1 texture save/load support(almost from Henrik Rydgård)

Licenses
--------
This library, for my convenience, incorporates code from a variety of public domain or similarly-licensed code. This is the list:

* glew (GL extension wrangler), MIT license. TODO: should just use a submodule.
* rg_etc1. ZLIB license.

If you're not okay with the licenses above, don't use this code.

I hereby release all code here not under the licenses above under the MIT license.
