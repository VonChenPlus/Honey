// NativeApp implementation for platforms that will use that framework, like:
// Android, Linux, MacOSX.
//
// Native is a cross platform framework. It's not very mature and mostly
// just built according to the needs of my own apps.
//
// Windows has its own code that bypasses the framework entirely.


// Background worker threads should be spawned in NativeInit and joined
// in NativeShutdown.
