// from the framework, which exposes the native JNI api which is a bit
// more complicated.

// The very first function to be called after NativeGetAppInfo. Even NativeMix is not called
// before this, although it may be called at any point in time afterwards (on any thread!)
// This functions must NOT call OpenGL. Main thread.
