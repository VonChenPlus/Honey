// Implement these functions and you've got a native app. These are called
// from the framework, which exposes the native JNI api which is a bit
// more complicated.

// The very first function to be called after NativeGetAppInfo. Even NativeMix is not called
// before this, although it may be called at any point in time afterwards (on any thread!)
// This functions must NOT call OpenGL. Main thread.

// Should not initialize anything screen-size-dependent - do that in NativeResized.

// Useful for triggering audio events, saving a few ms.
// If you don't care about touch latency, just do a no-op implementation of this.
